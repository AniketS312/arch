# Arch project

## Tech Stack used
* HTML
* CSS (SCSS)
* Javascript

## General Info
The Arch project was built to showcase my abilties to use HTML/CSS/Javascript and was my first project to test out Github pages as it provides a safe space to launch with SSL certificate. Small amount of javascript was used to make the menu mobile friendly. This design was inpired by a challnged from Frontend Mentors this was a premium challange that I did not have access to but I was able to quickly adapt and find speerate iamges and text content to fill in place of their provided text. For more javascript heavy projects please ahve a look at my profile at [anikets.dev](anikets.dev). Thank you
