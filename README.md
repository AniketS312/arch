# Arch project

## Tech Stack used
* HTML
* CSS (SCSS)
* Javascript

## General Info
The Arch project was built to showcase my abilties to use HTML/CSS/JavaScript and was my first project to test out Github pages as it provides a safe space to launch with SSL certificate. Small amount of javascript was used to make the menu mobile friendly as this project was intended to be HTML and CSS (specifically SCSS) heavy. This design was inpired by a challnge from Frontend Mentors. This was a premium challange that I did not have access to but I was able to quickly adapt and find seperate images and text content to fill in place of their provided text. For more javascript heavy projects please ahve a look at my profile at [anikets.dev](anikets.dev). Thank you
